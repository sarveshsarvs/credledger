Decentralized skill credential platform â€” verifiable, secure, and tamper-proof certifications on blockchain.

## Overview  
This project is built as part of **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**.  
It is a **blockchain-powered skill credential platform** that enables secure, tamper-proof, and verifiable digital certifications for students, professionals, and institutions.  

Unlike traditional systems that rely on centralized authorities, our solution uses **blockchain and W3C Verifiable Credentials** to ensure:  
- Trustworthy verification of skills  
- Prevention of fraud or tampering  
- Decentralized identity for learners  
- Easy sharing of credentials with employers or institutions  

---

## Problem  
- Current digital certificates and resumes are prone to forgery.  
- Verification is manual, slow, and often unreliable.  
- Institutions and employers lack a unified, secure platform for skill verification.  

---

## Proposed Solution  
- A **Blockchain-based credential system** where skills/certificates are issued, stored, and verified securely.  
- Uses **W3C Verifiable Credentials** for interoperability and global standards.  
- Employs **Decentralized Identity (DID)** for user ownership of their credentials.  
- Employers/institutions can instantly verify authenticity without intermediaries.  

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)  
- **Blockchain**: [To be finalized â€“ e.g., Ethereum / Hyperledger / Polygon]  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express  
- **Frontend**: React.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB / IPFS for decentralized storage  
- **Identity & Credentials**: W3C Verifiable Credentials, DID standards

## Current Status  
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§  
- System design completed  
- Implementation of core modules (issuance, verification, blockchain integration) will be updated soon  
- Code and detailed documentation will be pushed in upcoming commits  

---

## Future Scope  
- Integration with university and corporate hiring systems  
- Mobile app for credential management  
- AI-driven skill analytics and recommendation engine
